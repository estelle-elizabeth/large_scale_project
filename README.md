# Instructions on how to initialize server:
This is what I have so far with django 

I followed django tutorial from https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/

I have gotten to part 2 where I have a database and populate a bit. 

I have 3 tables: user, truck, user_truck. 

You need Django and postgresql.

once you download the files, get to mysite directory which has manage.py and run 'python manage.py shell' in command line.


The database will be empty so you need to populate. (you can find how to do so in the tutorial website on tutorial02)

You also need to change the postgres id and password based on your id and password in settings.py inside mysite file.
